March Madness Simulator to settle a dispute

What is the optimal way to pick your March Madness bracket? Some may say that it's optimal to pick zero upsets no matter what.
This simulator was written to disprove that, but accidentally maybe proves it instead. 

To run simulations, modify iterations and/or players in the main function, and run main.py
